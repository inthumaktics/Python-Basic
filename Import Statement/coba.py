print("Sung Jinwoo (성진우) is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. \n He is the strongest hunter in the world and the second Shadow Monarch, having inherited the position from his predecessor Ashborn. \n Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, Jinwoo got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected 'as' the Player of the System, giving him the unique ability to grow 'in' strength without restraint. \n As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, Jinwoo eventually rose to power 'as' humanity's greatest hunter.")
